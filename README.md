Instead of: "Initiate the process."
Use: "Start the process."
Why it works: "Start" is a common, everyday word that everyone understands. "Initiate" is more formal and less familiar.
Instead of: "Execute the command."
Use: "Run the command."
Why it works: "Run" is a simpler, more direct verb that conveys the same meaning. "Execute" sounds more technical and formal.
Instead of: "Implement the solution."
Use: "Use the solution." or "Put the solution in place."
Why it works: "Implement" is abstract. "Use" or "put in place" are more concrete and easier to visualize.
Instead of: "Configure the settings."
Use: "Set up the settings." or "Change the settings."
Why it works: "Configure" is technical jargon. "Set up" and "change" are more familiar and easier to understand.
2. Objects & Concepts:

Instead of: "The repository."
Use: "The storage area." or "The saved files."
Why it works: "Repository" is a technical term used in software development. "Storage area" or "saved files" are more general and understandable.
Instead of: "The algorithm."
Use: "The steps." or "The process."
Why it works: "Algorithm" is a mathematical and computer science term. "Steps" or "process" are more general and explain the concept in simpler terms.
Instead of: "The interface."

Why it works: "Interface" is a broad technical term. "Screen" or "way you interact" are more specific and easier to understand.
Instead of: "Parameters."
Use: "Settings" or "Options."
Why it works: "Parameters" is a very technical word. "Settings" and "options" are used in everyday speech.
3. Describing Functionality:

Instead of: "Optimize performance."
Use: "Make it faster." or "Make it work better."
Why it works: "Optimize" is a technical term. "Faster" and "work better" are clearer and more direct.
Instead of: "Deactivate the feature."
Use: "Turn off the feature."
Why it works: "Deactivate" is formal and less common. "Turn off" is a simple, everyday phrase.
Instead of: "Establish a connection."
Use: "Connect."
Why it works: "Establish" adds unneeded complexity. “Connect” is simple and direct.

## 7. How can using examples and visuals help in explaining complex concepts more clearly?\
